Text1,UI,"- Respect all players. No racial/homophobic/hate speech.\n- We will not tolerate any cheating/exploiting!\n- Do not kill other players, such as by setting traps or using fire. This is a PvE server.\n- Do not go to another player’s base that isn’t yours. Base raiding is prohibited, even if the base doesn’t have a LCB.\n- Do not build within 100 blocks of the lobby, horde base, cardinal teleports, trader, or any reset zone.\n- Do not build in prefabs or POI's.\n- FARMS are only 31×31 max (one level). If you go over the limit Team Members will wipe the area.\n- No more than 3 of each station per player, per type. You can NOT combine if in a team. This is PER PLAYER and PER LOCATION.\n- No more than 30 trees max per base, team, player!\n- Vehicles at your own risk! We will NOT replace any vehicles. Vehicles have always been glitchy. They are known to just disappear, fall to the ground and get stuck. If you use any type of vehicle it’s on you. We will not be responsible. Keep vehicles in your backpacks/toolbelt or storage crate when not in use. Reboots wipe all vehicles left out in-game. Vehicles are known to cause maps to glitch which causes them to disappear, fall to the ground and get stuck. Drones that are left out will be removed just like vehicles. Please pick them up before you exit the game."
